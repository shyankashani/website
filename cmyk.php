					<h2>
						Summary
					</h2>
					<p>
						The <a href="http://cmyk.innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">CMYK Designathon</a> is an annual design summit hosted by Innovative Design at the University of California, Berkeley. Now in its 5th year, the summit brings together Bay Area students,  designers, and design leaders for workshops, lectures, and a flagship design competition.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2013, I worked on the team that developed the identity for the event. We wanted to create an aesthetic that was inviting to all skill-levels, and, at the same time, formidable enough to attract talented, seasoned designers.
					</p>
					<p>
						We created a series of logos that individually refer to C–M–Y–K, but that can only be understood when taken together. Each displays its respective color, along with a lighter, complicating, accent color.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Collaborators
					</h2>
					<p>
						 Elizabeth Lin (President); Jason Vizmanos (Team Leader); Alice Pang and Amy Clark (Designers).

						Formation #1
					</h2>
					<p>
						The logos most readily appear together in a square formation.
					</p>

				<div>
					<h2>
						Formation #2
					</h2>
					<p>
						But can also be presented in series, as they are <a href="http://cmyk.innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">here</a> on the CMYK website.

					<h2>
						Miniaturization
					</h2>
					<p>
						We also developed a miniaturization of the logo, along with clear typography, to be displayed in different scales and contexts.
