					Summary
				</h2>
				<p>
					Last year, I began an ongoing personal project to redesign the map of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system (BART) and its regional rail connections (Amtrak, Caltrain, Muni). I designed the map using Processing, a data visualization language, and have drawn inspiration from European wayfinding standards.
				</p>
				<p>
				The new map borrows old cues for consistency – like line colorations – but also reforms cumbersome naming conventions and introduces a grid whereby station labels and interconnections can be readily understood.
				<p>
				Most importantly, however, because the map was designed using Processing, it represents the potential to be dynamically updated, either by a central source, or by a distributed network of riders.
