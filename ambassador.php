				Khan Academy Ambassador Program
			</div>
			<div class='dynamic'>
				<div class="show">
					<p>
						At Khan Academy, there's an understanding that the organization's most important assets are its users. These folks include power users, volunteer translators, or parents and teachers spreading the word about Khan Academy, completely independently. The Ambassador Program was conceived to reward these folks (and others) for sharing Khan Academy, and make it even easier for them to do so.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Logo
					</h2>
					<p>
						The basic unit of the logo for the Ambassador Program is the classic Khan Academy leaf. The arrangement of the leaves come from two inspirations, one being the laurel wreath &mdash; a representation of academia &mdash; and the other being the crisscrossed branches of the olive tree &mdash; an ambassadorial symbol. The leaves are arrangeed so as to envelope Khan Academy's initials. It was my hope with this logo to convey the officiality of the Ambassador Program, while at the same time preserving the charming playfulness of the Khan Academy brand.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Landing Page
					</h2>
					<p>
						The landing page of the Ambassador Program was designed to be simple and informative. Under the familiar Khan Academy banner, users can watch an introductory video about the Ambassador Program, and go ahead and become one.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Introductory Video
					</h2>
					<p>
						Playing the introductory video dims lights in the user interface, creating a focused viewing mode, while at the same time maintaining the pronouncement of the call to action for becoming an Ambassador.
					</p>
					<p>
						Users can choose to become Ambassadors at anytime during the video.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Detail Sections
					</h2>
					<p>
						Scrolling down reveals three sections: <em>Become an Ambassador</em>, <em>Share Khan Academy</em>, and <em>See your impact</em>. These sections offer details on what users can expect from the Ambassador Program.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Dashboard
					</h2>
					<p>
						Upon selecting <em>Become an Ambassador</em>, users are prompted, by a modal window, to log in to or sign up for Khan Academy. Their Ambassador Dashboard is then linked to and populated by the information in their Khan Academy account.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Ambassador Link
					</h2>
					<p>
						In the top right corner of the dashboard, Ambassadors can find their own unique <em>Ambassador link</em>, a direct URL to Khan Academy that never changes. As an Ambassador, each time somebody uses your link to visit or sign up for Khan Academy, it counts toward your contribution to the community.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Reach
					</h2>
					<p>
						On the <em>Reach</em> section of the dashboard, Ambassadors can see the impact they've made on the community in two ways. The first is through <em>Referrals</em>, which is the number of folks who've used their <em>Ambassador link</em> to sign up for Khan Academy. The second is through <em>Estimated Referral Minutes</em>, an approximation of the amount of time the people they've referred have spent learning on the site.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both of these measures are presented skeuomorphically &mdash; like scores on scoreboards &mdash; to convey that an Ambassador's impact is not merely statistical, but a real achievement in helping others reach their learning goals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Toolkit
					</h2>
					<p>
						In the <em>Toolkit</em>, Ambassadors can find three shortcuts to sharing Khan Academy &mdash; through <em>Email</em>, <em>Facebook</em>, and <em>Twitter</em>. Each of the three buttons open corresponding modal windows with pre-written (though editable) messages that include the Ambassador's link.
					</p>
					<p>
						We tried to make it as easy as possible for Ambassadors to share Khan Academy right through their dashboards.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h2>
						Presentation Resources
					</h2>
					<p>
						Finally, at the bottom of the dashboard, Ambassadors can download <em>Presentation Resources</em>. These are a collection of slides and fliers in a zipped folder that Ambassadors can download, print, and present at parent meetings, teacher trainings, and other events.
