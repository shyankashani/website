					<h2>
						Summary
					</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="http://innovativedesign.club/" target="_blank">Innovative Design</a> is the University of California, Berkeley's student-run creative agency.
					</p>
					<p>
						Commonly abbreviated as <em>InnoD</em>, the agency is a collaboration of designers, photographers, and web developers &mdash; providing a breadth of design products and services for University peers and professional clients.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2013, I led design on the team responsible for <em>InnoD</em>'s new identity, the centerpiece of which was the new three-circle climb, pictured in these slides.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Collaborators
					</h2>
					<p>
						Elizabeth Lin (President); Jason Vizmanos (Marketing Team Leader); Alice Pang and Amy Clark (Marketing Designers).

					<h2>
						Background
					</h2>
					<p>
						At the time of the development of the new identity in 2013, <em>InnoD</em> was rapidly professionalizing and expanding into new fields of design. Whereas it began almost solely as a collection of graphic designers, by 2013 it was spreading into web development, photography, and later into product, videography, UI/UX, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						The goal of the rebranding was to bring the agencyâ€™s outdated identity up to speed with its new purview and its ambitious future.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Old vs. New
					</h2>
					<p>
						The original logo persistently struck us as awkward. Its circles were, inexplicably, donuts. And the fact that these circles were neither overlapping nor seperated denoted an indecisive <em>neither-here-nor-there</em> quality.
					</p>
					<p>
						The awkwardness of the original logo was compounded by the innappropriateness of its use of dark red, a doddery color out of step with <a href="http://brand.universityofcalifornia.edu/index.html#!" target="_blank">the brand of the University</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Loopholes were literally closed, and the circles were made to decisively overlap, representing the intersectionality of InnoD's three original tiers: graphic design, web design, and photography. Red was replaced with a modern, sprightly cyan.

					<h2>
						Creating a Canvas
					</h2>
					<p>
					 	An important goal of this project was to create a mark that could serve not only as a positive space and a negative space, but, more importantly, as a <em>canvas</em>. The new mark <em>had</em> to be amenable to the creativity of future generations; we felt this was essential to ensuring the identity's longevity.
					</p>
					<p>
					 	I love what future generations of InnoD'ers have done. Here you can see a number of takes on the mark used for various events and special occasions.
					</p>

					<h2>
						Unexpected Media
					</h2>
					<p>
						Another goal of the redesign was to create a mark that could be recreated in any media, even the most unexpected. Here we see the mark in 3D print.
